## Guide

### Unlocking Google Applications
To use Google applications such as Google Docs, click on the "add user" icon, which will be the third icon from the right on the top right. Sign-in to your school account normally. 

### Connecting Bluetooth Devices
To connect Bluetooth devices such as earbuds, click on the "Bluetooth" icon, which will be the third icon from the right on the bottom left. This will open a new tab that allows you to pair, connect, and disconnect Bluetooth devices

### Exiting full screen while watching videos
One problem unique to Alohomora is that it is not possible to exit fullscreen while watching videos on websites such as YouTube and Netflix. To exit fullscreen, simply press Ctrl+T, which will open a new tab, exiting you from fullscreen.

### Exiting the exploit
To exit the exploit and use the Chromebook normally, simply hold down the Power button on the left side of your Chromebook, then click "Sign-out"

### Circumventing network blocks/firewalls
While using school Wi-Fi, network blocks for things like Netflix and CoolMathGames will still be present. To circumvent this, you will need to download a VPN extension. Most VPN extensions are also blocked, but uVPN has been found to work, linked here: http://tinyurl.com/t5kktukv. The only available free servers are located in Europe, so latency and avalibility for websites like Netflix will be affected. The Madrid server has been found to have the lowest latency, while the Milan server retains most popular Netflix shows due to Italian entertainment laws.

### Using kiosk app normally
You may sometimes need to use the kiosk app for things like standardized testing. To use the kiosk app normally, hold down the Power button on the left side of your Chromebook, then click "Sign-out" in order to exit the exploit. Then boot into the kiosk app normally.
